## Questions that will be answered

This analysis will be primarily focused on the individual winrates for each tank although other statistics may be considered and mentioned. The data scraped will provide a tanks nationality, class, tier, and if they are premium tanks. On top of this, the data provides win rates and player counts for each individual server. Using this data, this project will seek to:

* Observe and determine differences in player count and win rates by regions
* Determine differences in winrates based on different characteristics (tier/type/nation)
* Determine whether there is a balancing issue when it come to premium tanks (do they have an unfair advantage)
* Determine any particularly strong tanks and what characteristics they possess

## About World of Tanks

### World of Tanks Gameplay

World of Tanks is a massively multiplayer online game created by Wargaming. Released August 12, 2010 it continues to support relatively strong player counts. In World of Tanks, players take control of a single armored tank of their choice, and is placed into a battle on a random map. The player has control over the vehicle's movement, firing, and can communicate with allied players and all the other players through typed or voice chat. A simple random match is won either by destroying all vehicles on the opposing team or capturing the opposing team's base by staying in it for long enough without being damaged by another tank.

### The Tanks in the Game

In World of Tanks, vehicles are modeled to closely resemble their counterparts in real life. For game balance and for better ease of play, certain tank parameters have been simplified or modified from their actual historical values. World of Tanks has five different types of vehicles: light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, tank destroyers, and self-propelled artillery. The game currently includes over 600 armored vehicles from Britain, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, the Soviet Union, Sweden, and the United States. Additional premium and collectors' vehicles are available outside the tech trees for cash or in-game credits.
