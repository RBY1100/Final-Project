The data scraped will provide a tanks nationality, class, tier, and if they are premium tanks. On top of this, the data provides win rates and player counts for each individual server. Using this data, this project will seek to:\nObserve and determine differences in player count and win rates by regions\nDetermine differences in winrates based on different characteristics (tier/type/nation)\nDetermine whether there is a balancing issue when it come to premium tanks (do they have an unfair advantage)\nDetermine any particularly strong tanks and what characteristics they possess\nAbout World of Tanks\nWorld of Tanks Gameplay\nWorld of Tanks is a massively multiplayer online game created by Wargaming. Released August 12, 2010 it continues to support relatively strong player counts. In World of Tanks, players take control of a single armored tank of their choice, and is placed into a battle on a random map. The player has control over the vehicle’s movement, firing, and can communicate with allied players and all the other players through typed or voice chat. A simple random match is won either by destroying all vehicles on the opposing team or capturing the opposing team’s base by staying in it for long enough without being damaged by another tank.\nVideo demonstrating World of Tanks gameplay:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tanks in the Game\nIn World of Tanks, vehicles are modeled to closely resemble their counterparts in real life. For game balance and for better ease of play, certain tank parameters have been simplified or modified from their actual historical values. World of Tanks has five different types of vehicles: light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, tank destroyers, and self-propelled artillery. The game currently includes over 600 armored vehicles from Britain, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, the Soviet Union, Sweden, and the United States. Additional premium and collectors’ vehicles are available outside the tech trees for cash or in-game credits.\nAbout the Data\nThis data was scraped from the Wot-News website. This website pulls data from Wargamings servers in order to provide data on server activity and tanks statistics. This data can all be viewed on the Wot News website at: https://wot-news.com/. Some data that wasn’t included on Wot News such as whether a tank was a premium tank or not was manually added.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe Tanks in World of Tanks\nWorld of tanks contains more than 600 different tanks. All of them have different characteristics. This project will use a few characteristics such as Type, Tier, Nation, and its premium status to see if they have any major effect on winrate.\nTank Type\nWorld of Tanks separates their tanks into 5 different categories; light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, tank destroyers, and artillery. In general, these tanks all fit into a different niche. Light tanks are the scouts for the team, running ahead to spot enemy tanks for their teamate to shoot at. Medium tanks are you’re jack-of-all trades class, being decent in most aspects but not spectacular. Heavy utilize their heavy armor to take and hold the most important parts of the map. Tank destroyers sit behind using their powerful guns to snipe enemies from a distance. Artillery are the support class, specializing in removing dug in opponents from an extreme range. Looking at the data, are any of these niches appear to be more influential than others?\nBoxplot of Tank Type by Win Rate\n\n\n\nMean Win Rate by Tank Type\n\n# A tibble: 5 x 2\n  Type           `Mean Win Rate by Tank Type`\n  <fct>                                 <dbl>\n1 Heavy Tank                             49.3\n2 Light Tank                             49.2\n3 Medium Tank                            49.3\n4 Artillery                              49.0\n5 Tank Destroyer                         49.1\n\nANOVA Test on Tank Type\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nType          4      8   2.114   0.415  0.798\nResiduals   691   3518   5.091               \n\nSimply looking at the comparative boxplots and observing the mean win rate for each class, it appears fairly apparent that Wargaming has balanced their tank classes fairly well. Performing an ANOVA test on the variable Type give us a p-value well above any threshold we would use to conclude Type has any noticeable effect on win rate.\n\n\n\n",
