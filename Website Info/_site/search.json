The data scraped will provide a tanks nationality, class, tier, and if they are premium tanks. On top of this, the data provides win rates and player counts for each individual server. Using this data, this project will seek to:\nObserve and determine differences in player count and win rates by regions\nDetermine differences in winrates based on different characteristics (tier/type/nation)\nDetermine whether there is a balancing issue when it come to premium tanks (do they have an unfair advantage)\nDetermine any particularly strong tanks and what characteristics they possess\nAbout World of Tanks\nWorld of Tanks Gameplay\nWorld of Tanks is a massively multiplayer online game created by Wargaming. Released August 12, 2010 it continues to support relatively strong player counts. In World of Tanks, players take control of a single armored tank of their choice, and is placed into a battle on a random map. The player has control over the vehicle’s movement, firing, and can communicate with allied players and all the other players through typed or voice chat. A simple random match is won either by destroying all vehicles on the opposing team or capturing the opposing team’s base by staying in it for long enough without being damaged by another tank.\nVideo demonstrating World of Tanks gameplay:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tanks in the Game\nIn World of Tanks, vehicles are modeled to closely resemble their counterparts in real life. For game balance and for better ease of play, certain tank parameters have been simplified or modified from their actual historical values. World of Tanks has five different types of vehicles: light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, tank destroyers, and self-propelled artillery. The game currently includes over 600 armored vehicles from Britain, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, the Soviet Union, Sweden, and the United States. Additional premium and collectors’ vehicles are available outside the tech trees for cash or in-game credits.\nAbout the Data\nThis data was scraped from the Wot-News website. This website pulls data from Wargamings servers in order to provide data on server activity and tanks statistics. This data can all be viewed on the Wot News website at: https://wot-news.com/. Some data that wasn’t included on Wot News such as whether a tank was a premium tank or not was manually added.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe Tanks in World of Tanks\nWorld of tanks contains more than 600 different tanks. All of them have different characteristics. This project will use a few characteristics such as Type, Tier, Nation, and its premium status to see if they have any major effect on winrate.\nTank Type\nWorld of Tanks separates their tanks into 5 different categories; light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, tank destroyers, and artillery. In general, these tanks all fit into a different niche. Light tanks are the scouts for the team, running ahead to spot enemy tanks for their teamate to shoot at. Medium tanks are you’re jack-of-all trades class, being decent in most aspects but not spectacular. Heavy utilize their heavy armor to take and hold the most important parts of the map. Tank destroyers sit behind using their powerful guns to snipe enemies from a distance. Artillery are the support class, specializing in removing dug in opponents from an extreme range. Looking at the data, are any of these niches appear to be more influential than others?\nBoxplot of Tank Type by Win Rate\n\n\n\nMean Win Rate by Tank Type\n\n# A tibble: 5 x 3\n  Type           `Mean Win Rate by Tank Type` `Total Number of Type`\n  <fct>                                 <dbl>                  <int>\n1 Heavy Tank                             49.3                    161\n2 Light Tank                             49.2                    146\n3 Medium Tank                            49.3                    207\n4 Artillery                              49.0                     52\n5 Tank Destroyer                         49.1                    130\n\nANOVA Test on Tank Type\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nType          4      8   2.114   0.415  0.798\nResiduals   691   3518   5.091               \n\nSimply looking at the comparative boxplots and observing the mean win rate for each class, it appears fairly apparent that Wargaming has balanced their tank classes fairly well. Performing an ANOVA test on the variable Type give us a p-value well above any threshold we would use to conclude Type has any noticeable effect on win rate.\nTank Tier\nWorld of Tanks uses a matchmaker system to make for balanced teams every match. Based on this, they have a built in tier system with each tank attached to a certain tier based on how powerful that tank is. In this case, tier 1 includes the weakest tanks in the game while tier 10 includes the most powerful tanks. World of Tanks has a built in matchmaker that will make sure there are an equal number of tank from each tier on each team. Different tiers can be matched up with tank +/- 2 tier from their own. So for example, a tier 5 tank oculd be matched with tier 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 tanks although there will always be an equal number of tier 5’s on each team. Are there any differences between the winrates of different tiers?\nBoxplot of Tank Tier by Win Rate\n\n\n\nMean Win Rate by Tank Tier\n\n# A tibble: 10 x 3\n   Tier  `Mean Win Rate by Tank Tier` `Total Number of Tier`\n   <fct>                        <dbl>                  <int>\n 1 1                             48.1                     12\n 2 2                             49.1                     51\n 3 3                             49.3                     56\n 4 4                             49.6                     53\n 5 5                             49.7                     67\n 6 6                             49.5                     79\n 7 7                             49.5                     74\n 8 8                             48.7                    156\n 9 9                             49.0                     69\n10 10                            49.4                     79\n\nANOVA Test on Tank Tier\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)  \nTier          9     95  10.541   2.107 0.0269 *\nResiduals   686   3432   5.002                 \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nLooking at the boxplot, the different tiers appear to be fairly even in winrate with the exception of tier 1 which is significantly lower overall. Tier 8 also appears somewhat smaller but less so than tier 1. It is important to note that the tiers with the 2 lowest winrates have the most and least amount of tanks in those tier respectably. The mean winrate for each tier also indicates a similar trend. Performing an ANOVA test on the variable Type give us a p-value that does appear to indicate that tier does seem to have a statistically significant effect on a tanks win rate.\nTank Nation\nWorld of Tanks includes a variety of different tanks from different nations. Each nation tends to have a somewhat different play style but they are suppose to be generally balanced with all nations said to be just as powerful as the others. There are certainly claims that some nations are more powerful than others. Particularly, that Russian tanks are overall better due to a large portion of the player base being from Russia. There are also claims that because German tanks were some of the first tanks released in the game, they are generally not as powerful as the newer tanks. However, does the data support any of these claims.\nBoxplot of Tank Nation by Win Rate\n\n\n\nMean Win Rate by Tank Nation\n\n# A tibble: 11 x 3\n   Nation         `Mean Win Rate by Tank Nati… `Total Number of Natio…\n   <fct>                                 <dbl>                   <int>\n 1 China                                  49.5                      45\n 2 Czechoslovakia                         49.5                      18\n 3 France                                 49.3                      77\n 4 Germany                                49.5                     127\n 5 Italy                                  49.5                      18\n 6 Japan                                  48.7                      26\n 7 Poland                                 49.1                      21\n 8 Sweden                                 48.3                      31\n 9 United Kingdom                         49.5                      85\n10 United States                          49.1                     108\n11 USSR                                   49.0                     140\n\nANOVA Test on Tank Nation\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nNation       10     67   6.696   1.326  0.212\nResiduals   685   3459   5.050               \n\nLooking at the boxplots, the different nations appear to be fairly even in winrate with the exception of Swedish tanks and Japanese tanks which are noticeably lower overall. The means appear to support these observations as well. Performing an ANOVA test on the variable Type give us a p-value that appears to indicate that a tanks nation doesn’t seem to have a statistically significant effect on a tanks win rate. This means that while Sweden and Japan do appear to have some differences, they aren’t enough to be seen a statistically significant. Interestingly enough, it appears that while players say Russian tanks are overly powerful, the opposite appears to be true with Russian tanks mean win rate being the 3rd lowest out of all the nations. While at the same time, German tanks tend to have a relatively high mean win rate overall.\nPremium Tanks\nFinally, one way that Wargaming works to monetise their game is to sell unique tanks for real world currency. These tanks are wholly unique just like alll other tanks and many times support very unique or niche play styles. However, over the years, there have been claims that Wargaming intentionally makes these tanks more powerful than the normal tanks in order to incentivise their purchases. These claims of being “pay-to-win” have been prevalent for a long time. However, does the data appear to support these claims.\nBoxplot of Premium Status by Win Rate\n\n\n\nMean Win Rate by Premium Status\n\n# A tibble: 2 x 3\n  Premium `Mean Win Rate by Premium S… `Total Number of Premium/Non-P…\n  <fct>                          <dbl>                           <int>\n1 No                              48.6                             451\n2 Yes                             50.4                             245\n\nANOVA Test on Premium Status\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    \nPremium       1  524.1   524.1   121.1 <2e-16 ***\nResiduals   694 3002.3     4.3                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nLooking at the boxplots, there does appear to be a significant difference in the win rate between premium and non-premium tanks. Looking at the means, premium tanks appear to have an almost 2% high winrate than non-premium tanks. Running an ANOVA test on the premium status of the tanks, the p-value is very low indicating that premium status does certianly seem to effect the win rate of a tank.\n\n\n\n",
