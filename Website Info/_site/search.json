The data scraped will provide a tanks nationality, class, tier, and if they are premium tanks. On top of this, the data provides win rates and player counts for each individual server. Using this data, this project will seek to:\nObserve and determine differences in player count and win rates by regions\nDetermine differences in winrates based on different characteristics (tier/type/nation)\nDetermine whether there is a balancing issue when it come to premium tanks (do they have an unfair advantage)\nDetermine any particularly strong tanks and what characteristics they possess\nAbout World of Tanks\nWorld of Tanks Gameplay\nWorld of Tanks is a massively multiplayer online game created by Wargaming. Released August 12, 2010 it continues to support relatively strong player counts. In World of Tanks, players take control of a single armored tank of their choice, and is placed into a battle on a random map. The player has control over the vehicle’s movement, firing, and can communicate with allied players and all the other players through typed or voice chat. A simple random match is won either by destroying all vehicles on the opposing team or capturing the opposing team’s base by staying in it for long enough without being damaged by another tank.\nVideo demonstrating World of Tanks gameplay:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tanks in the Game\nIn World of Tanks, vehicles are modeled to closely resemble their counterparts in real life. For game balance and for better ease of play, certain tank parameters have been simplified or modified from their actual historical values. World of Tanks has five different types of vehicles: light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, tank destroyers, and self-propelled artillery. The game currently includes over 600 armored vehicles from Britain, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, the Soviet Union, Sweden, and the United States. Additional premium and collectors’ vehicles are available outside the tech trees for cash or in-game credits.\nAbout the Data\nThis data was scraped from the Wot-News website. This website pulls data from Wargamings servers in order to provide data on server activity and tanks statistics. This is updated daily and this project will take data from the last 60 days from the current day. This data can all be viewed on the Wot News website at: https://wot-news.com/. Some data that wasn’t included on Wot News such as whether a tank was a premium tank or not was manually added.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "World of Tanks Data by Region",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nWorld of Tanks Different Regions\nWorld of Tanks is a global game and thus runs on 4 major distinct servers. The US server encompasses the North American region, the EU server covers most of the EU region, the RU servers covers primarily Russia but also Eastern Europe, the SEA covers most of Eastern Asia. In general the EU, US, and RU servers are run fairly similar when it comes to new updates and tanks released. The SEA servers are run by a seperate company which has a degree of freedom when it comes to new content added. It is important to note that due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Wargaming has effectively exited Russia and Belarus and handed control of the RU server to a Belorussian company so the status of the RU server may change in the near future. There is also a South American and Oceania server however, those servers contain so few people, it is typically not tracked and thus incredibly difficult to find data on therefore, those servers are not included in this study.\nThe World of Tanks Playerbase\nWhen calculating the number of play, a “play” is added to the count whenever a player hits the “play” button in the lobby. Because there are usually 30 players in a game this means that a single game will typically add 30 counts to the “play” count (this is approximate as there are bots and games with less than 30 players meaning that there are many games with less than 30 players). As of now:\n\n[1] \"There are a total of 1000195757 plays and approximately 33339859 games ran in the last 60 days.\"\n\nHowever, these players are not evenly distributed across these 4 servers.\nPie Chart for Percentage of Plays by Server\n\n\n\nTable of Plays by Server\n\n# A tibble: 4 x 3\n  Region `Total Plays` Percent\n  <chr>          <int> <chr>  \n1 EU         164429952 16.4%  \n2 RU         741447650 74.1%  \n3 SEA         66699114 6.7%   \n4 US          27619041 2.8%   \n\nIn general, Russia and Eastern Europe are where the vast majority player base World of Tanks games are played. This is followed very distantly by the EU. Surprisingly, the United States makes up a very small portion of the World of Tanks player base even though it is known to have a large video game market in general. South East Asia also has a relatively small portion of the player base. Credit where credit is due to Wargaming considering they have severed all ties with the Russia over the Ukraine invasion considering the majority of their business appears to be reliant on Russian and Eastern European players.\nServer Effect on Winrate\nSince each server is separate from each other and it isn’t convenient for player from different regions to switch servers, it might be interesting to compare player performance differences between the servers. Is there a difference in winrate based on the server played on?\nBoxplot of Winrate by Server Played\n\n\n\nMean Winrate by Server Played\n\n# A tibble: 4 x 3\n  Region `Mean Percent by Region Played` `Total Number of Tanks`\n  <chr>                            <dbl>                   <int>\n1 EU                                49.2                     693\n2 RU                                49.3                     710\n3 SEA                               49.4                     710\n4 US                                48.9                     695\n\nANOVA Test on Server Played\n\n              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)   \nRegion         3    102   33.84   4.559 0.00343 **\nResiduals   2804  20817    7.42                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nLooking at the boxplot for winrate by server, it is hard to tell any differences in means as the there are many outliers that make it hard to see differences that aren’t major. Looking at the table of means however, there does appear to be somewhat of a difference between the servers. It appears that the US players have a worse winrate overall than the other servers while SEA players have the best winrate overall. Performing an ANOVA test on the variable Region give us a p-value that does appear to indicate that tier does seem to have a statistically significant effect on players win rate.\nServer Effect on Tank Nationality Choices\nOne interesting thing to check is to see whether players tend to gravitate towards the tanks from their home country. For example will the players on the US server play Us tanks more than other servers and vice versa? * Note that there was an update that released new American Heavy tanks fairly recently so US tanks may be picked at a higher rate as a result\nPie Chart for Percentage of Tank Nationality Chosen for the EU Server\n\n\n\nPie Chart for Percentage of Tank Nationality Chosen for the RU Server\n\n\n\nPie Chart for Percentage of Tank Nationality Chosen for the US Server\n\n\n\nPie Chart for Percentage of Tank Nationality Chosen for the SEA Server\n\n\n\nInterestingly, this trend does appear to somewhat be true with the exception of the Asia server. The Asian server had large concentrations in US and Russian tanks while they had much less games played in other tanks. However, of the 3 remaining servers, the RU server appears to show the highest percentage of Russian tanks, the US server has the highest percentage of US tanks played. The EU server is a little more complicated as it doesn’t pertain to one country. However, the EU server still has the largest number of German players although this doesn’t appear to hold true for other EU countries.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe Tanks in World of Tanks\nWorld of tanks contains more than 600 different tanks. All of them have different characteristics. This project will use a few characteristics such as Type, Tier, Nation, and its premium status to see if they have any major effect on winrate.\nTank Type\nWorld of Tanks separates their tanks into 5 different categories; light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, tank destroyers, and artillery. In general, these tanks all fit into a different niche. Light tanks are the scouts for the team, running ahead to spot enemy tanks for their teamate to shoot at. Medium tanks are you’re jack-of-all trades class, being decent in most aspects but not spectacular. Heavy utilize their heavy armor to take and hold the most important parts of the map. Tank destroyers sit behind using their powerful guns to snipe enemies from a distance. Artillery are the support class, specializing in removing dug in opponents from an extreme range. Looking at the data, are any of these niches appear to be more influential than others?\nCurrent Percentage Breakdown for Tank Type\n\n\n\nAt the moment, the player base appears to be preferring playing heavy tanks, medium tanks, and tank destroyers the most. This does make sense considering light tanks are somewhat difficult to play and artillery is generally seen as boring to play by much of the player base.\nBoxplot of Tank Type by Win Rate\n\n\n\nMean Win Rate by Tank Type\n\n# A tibble: 5 x 3\n  Type           `Mean Win Rate by Tank Type` `Total Number of Type`\n  <fct>                                 <dbl>                  <int>\n1 Heavy Tank                             49.3                    161\n2 Light Tank                             49.2                    146\n3 Medium Tank                            49.3                    207\n4 Artillery                              49.0                     52\n5 Tank Destroyer                         49.1                    130\n\nANOVA Test on Tank Type\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nType          4      8   2.114   0.415  0.798\nResiduals   691   3518   5.091               \n\nSimply looking at the comparative boxplots and observing the mean win rate for each class, it appears fairly apparent that Wargaming has balanced their tank classes fairly well. Performing an ANOVA test on the variable Type give us a p-value well above any threshold we would use to conclude Type has any noticeable effect on win rate.\nTank Tier\nWorld of Tanks uses a matchmaker system to make for balanced teams every match. Based on this, they have a built in tier system with each tank attached to a certain tier based on how powerful that tank is. In this case, tier 1 includes the weakest tanks in the game while tier 10 includes the most powerful tanks. World of Tanks has a built in matchmaker that will make sure there are an equal number of tank from each tier on each team. Different tiers can be matched up with tank +/- 2 tier from their own. So for example, a tier 5 tank oculd be matched with tier 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 tanks although there will always be an equal number of tier 5’s on each team. Are there any differences between the winrates of different tiers?\nCurrent Percentage Breakdown for Tank Tier\n\n\n\nIt appears that about 2/3rd of games played are played at tier 8, 9 and 10. This makes sense as they require the most work to get to and thus take the most time to get the XP needed to move up to the next tier. On top of this, many players enjoy playing at tier 10 because they are the most powerful they can get. Tier 8 makes sense because it is the tier of the most popular premium tanks, tier 8 also has the most tanks out of any tier in the game.\nBoxplot of Tank Tier by Win Rate\n\n\n\nMean Win Rate by Tank Tier\n\n# A tibble: 10 x 3\n   Tier  `Mean Win Rate by Tank Tier` `Total Number of Tier`\n   <fct>                        <dbl>                  <int>\n 1 1                             48.1                     12\n 2 2                             49.1                     51\n 3 3                             49.3                     56\n 4 4                             49.6                     53\n 5 5                             49.7                     67\n 6 6                             49.5                     79\n 7 7                             49.5                     74\n 8 8                             48.7                    156\n 9 9                             49.0                     69\n10 10                            49.4                     79\n\nANOVA Test on Tank Tier\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)  \nTier          9     95  10.541   2.107 0.0269 *\nResiduals   686   3432   5.002                 \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nLooking at the boxplot, the different tiers appear to be fairly even in winrate with the exception of tier 1 which is significantly lower overall. Tier 8 also appears somewhat smaller but less so than tier 1. It is important to note that the tiers with the 2 lowest winrates have the most and least amount of tanks in those tier respectably. The mean winrate for each tier also indicates a similar trend. Performing an ANOVA test on the variable Type give us a p-value that does appear to indicate that tier does seem to have a statistically significant effect on a tanks win rate.\nTank Nationality\nWorld of Tanks includes a variety of different tanks from different nations. Each nation tends to have a somewhat different play style but they are suppose to be generally balanced with all nations said to be just as powerful as the others. There are certainly claims that some nations are more powerful than others. Particularly, that Russian tanks are overall better due to a large portion of the player base being from Russia. There are also claims that because German tanks were some of the first tanks released in the game, they are generally not as powerful as the newer tanks. However, does the data support any of these claims.\nCurrent Percentage Breakdown for Tank Nationality\n\n\n\nIt appears that the majority of games played are from the US, USSR/Russia, Germany or France. This does make sense for two reasons. To start, these nations have the most tanks in the game so they have more options in general for people to choose and players will naturally spend more time playing nations with more tanks. Second, these nations all have a server that can claim a nation as their own. The US server has US tanks, RU server has USSR/Russian tanks and so on.\nBoxplot of Tank Nation by Win Rate\n\n\n\nMean Win Rate by Tank Nation\n\n# A tibble: 11 x 3\n   Nation         `Mean Win Rate by Tank Nati… `Total Number of Natio…\n   <fct>                                 <dbl>                   <int>\n 1 China                                  49.5                      45\n 2 Czechoslovakia                         49.5                      18\n 3 France                                 49.3                      77\n 4 Germany                                49.5                     127\n 5 Italy                                  49.5                      18\n 6 Japan                                  48.7                      26\n 7 Poland                                 49.1                      21\n 8 Sweden                                 48.3                      31\n 9 United Kingdom                         49.5                      85\n10 United States                          49.1                     108\n11 USSR                                   49.0                     140\n\nANOVA Test on Tank Nation\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nNation       10     67   6.696   1.326  0.212\nResiduals   685   3459   5.050               \n\nLooking at the boxplots, the different nations appear to be fairly even in winrate with the exception of Swedish tanks and Japanese tanks which are noticeably lower overall. It also appears that Germany has the 3 best tanks in the game according to win rate. The means appear to support these observations as well. Performing an ANOVA test on the variable Type give us a p-value that appears to indicate that a tanks nation doesn’t seem to have a statistically significant effect on a tanks win rate. This means that while Sweden and Japan do appear to have some differences, they aren’t enough to be seen a statistically significant. Interestingly enough, it appears that while players say Russian tanks are overly powerful, the opposite appears to be true with Russian tanks mean win rate being the 3rd lowest out of all the nations. While at the same time, German tanks tend to have a relatively high mean win rate overall.\nPremium Tanks\nFinally, one way that Wargaming works to monetize their game is to sell unique tanks for real world currency. These tanks are wholly unique just like all other tanks and many times support very unique or niche play styles. However, over the years, there have been claims that Wargaming intentionally makes these tanks more powerful than the normal tanks in order to incentivize their purchases. These claims of being “pay-to-win” have been prevalent for a long time. However, does the data appear to support these claims.\nCurrent Percentage Breakdown for Premium Tank Games Played\n\n\n\nThe data shows that almost 1/3 of all games played are played with a premium tank. This is actually rather high and indicates that a large portion of the game is now played with tanks that cost real world currency. This could be due to a gameplay advantage or players might want to make sure they were getting their moneys worth out of purchasing a tank.\nBoxplot of Premium Status by Win Rate\n\n\n\nMean Win Rate by Premium Status\n\n# A tibble: 2 x 3\n  Premium `Mean Win Rate by Premium S… `Total Number of Premium/Non-P…\n  <fct>                          <dbl>                           <int>\n1 No                              48.6                             451\n2 Yes                             50.4                             245\n\nANOVA Test on Premium Status\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    \nPremium       1  524.1   524.1   121.1 <2e-16 ***\nResiduals   694 3002.3     4.3                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nLooking at the boxplots, there does appear to be a significant difference in the win rate between premium and non-premium tanks. Looking at the means, premium tanks appear to have an almost 2% high winrate than non-premium tanks. Running an ANOVA test on the premium status of the tanks, the p-value is very low indicating that premium status does certainly seem to effect the win rate of a tank.\n\n\n\n",
