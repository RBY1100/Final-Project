The 2 ideas I am currentely considering:

**1. Analyzing and displaying the 2022 Winter Olympic Results**

With the 2022 Winter Olympics set to wrap up within the week, were there any standout countries this year compared to others? How did contries perform relative to their past performance? Using R, I would data scrape the olympic results for each country in the 2022 Olympics. Using that data, I can create visual displays for how countries performed. I could even create a map that colors countries based on their performance. On top of this, I would also find it valuable to scrape past Winter Olympic results to see how countries performed this year relative to their past performance.

**2. Analyzing game statistics for the the video game World of Tanks**

I have been playing this game on and off for almost 8 years and have constantly heard balancing complaints. World of Tanks has a monetezation system where they sell "premium tanks" for real world currency and since its inception, there have been complaints from players that these tanks are better than the normal tanks. But is this proven by statistics or simply anecdotal expiriences? Thankfully, Wargaming (World of Tanks publisher) keeps track of all individual statistics for each tank on their website. Using R, I could scrape tank data from the website and create a dataset to perform data analysis on. Using this, I could create displays comparing premium tanks to normal tanks. On top of this, I could easily find the tanks that overperform and tanks that underperform.
