** Analyzing game statistics for the the video game World of Tanks**

I have been playing this game on and off for almost 8 years and have constantly heard balancing complaints. World of Tanks has a monetezation system where they sell "premium tanks" for real world currency and since its inception, there have been complaints from players that these tanks are better than the normal tanks. But is this proven by statistics or simply anecdotal expiriences? Thankfully, Wargaming (World of Tanks publisher) keeps track of all individual statistics for each tank on their website. Using R, I could scrape tank data from the website and create a dataset to perform data analysis on. Using this, I could create displays comparing premium tanks to normal tanks. On top of this, I could easily find the tanks that overperform and tanks that underperform.
